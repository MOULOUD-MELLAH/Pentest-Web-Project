# Pentest-Web-Project
Websites have always been sensitive elements of security. By definition, a website is a public server. Anyone in the world is supposed to
able to access it, including hackers.
Securing a web server is as important as securing the site or a web application, a poorly secured server may allow the deletion, addition or
modification of data hosted on the server.
On our project we are interested on the one hand, to the implementation of a website accessible on the Internet, and on the other hand, to
the implementation and exploitation of five vulnerabilities on this same site.
Therefore, in order to achieve our objective, our work is presented in 2 chapters:
          - The first chapter is devoted to the development environment and website hosting
          - The second chapter is devoted to the implementation of the five vulnerabilities one of which allows the 
             takeover of the target machine with privileges system.
